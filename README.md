**Dash Wind Streaming App**

This app queries a SQL database every second and uses the data to update the wind speed diagram and the wind direction diagram. The wind speed values are then binned in real time to generate the wind histogram data.

This app is hosted [here](https://dash-wind-streaming.herokuapp.com/dash/gallery/live-wind-data/)

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.
